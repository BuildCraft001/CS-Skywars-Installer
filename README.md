# CS Skywars Installer

This is an automatic installer for CS Skywars.

Features: 
- Check for the latest release version
- Download this version to the mods folder
- Remove unnecessary other mods
- Help with installing Forge & Optifine

### Use Cases
This installer only works with Microsoft's Minecraft Launcher and manually installed Forge on Windows 10 & 11. CurseForge and other modloaders or launchers are not supported, as they don't use Minecraft's default file paths.

### Important Note
Because of its behavior, the .exe gets flagged by ESET, Malwarebytes and potentially some other antivirus software. These are false positives, the file is totally safe. If you don't want to use our .exe, you can download the source from here and build it yourself.
